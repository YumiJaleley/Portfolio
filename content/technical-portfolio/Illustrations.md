summary: A range of illustrations I created on Adobe Photoshop, demonstrating, besides my practical skill, my knowledge in environment design, human anatomy, colour theory, composition & visual story telling.

"A Wonderful Day" (2019) is a Photoshop illustration created to develop my skills in environment design, anatomy, and visual storytelling. Inspired by apocalyptic media such as Battlefield, Borderlands, and Bioshock, I focused on ruined cityscapes, hostile biomes, and survival aesthetics to capture a world shaped by conflict.

I designed a warm colour palette to unify the piece and guide the eye: first to the child, then to the man, and finally to the surrounding environment. Composition and lighting establish a clear hierarchy of importance, while the fractured buildings, debris, and textures of rust and concrete set the stage for a hostile but believable setting.

Although my skills have since advanced, I view this work as an early step in my interest in creating post apocalyptic science fiction environments that combine atmosphere, narrative, and design intent."

"'Metal Men' series (2021â€“2022) was an experiment designed to challenge my understanding of human anatomy and lighting. All figures were created entirely from imagination without references, serving as a demonstration of my ability to construct convincing, fictional yet realistic forms."
