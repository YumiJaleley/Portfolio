Little Fred is a first person PC adventure puzzle game, presented through a blender animation as a game demo.
The objective of this BA project was to design a game with a complete absence of dialogue and to create a visually simplistic 
character, using colour theory and simple shape language to entice an empathetic response from the player.


### Skills Gained:
- Blender animation.
- Use of simple shape language to display character personalities.
- Use of colour theory for character & environment design.
- Video game level design.

# Storyboard

Setting the game in a world of geometric shapes, the main character, Fred, is a little red ball that falls into a deep cave system. The player-character (a cave dwelling blue cube) must guide Fred out the cave through a series of puzzles. The opening scene storyboard demonstrates Fred’s predicament, while the Level 1 storyboard demonstrates a portion of the gameplay.

# Concept Art - Colour Theory & Shape Language

The level progression is visualised through specific colour and shape themes, always contrasting with Fred’s Design to keep him at the center of the player's attention.

# Character Design

These characters were designed to be as simplistic as possible while still being sympathetic to the player. After a series of interviews and designs, Fred’s red ball design was deemed the most endearing.
