# Chaaya - Character Design

Chaaya is the protagonist that I have created for a choice based, open world adventure game. She is a widely renowned assassin, rumoured to be serving the will of the god of Judgement. She seeks to overthrow the crystal mining overlords, in order to stop their unethical production

### Skills Gained:
- Character silhouette
- Consistent shape language
- Colour theory
- Dynamic, high quality illustrations
- Accurate human anatomy

# Planning

In order to fully inform her visual design, I began with world building; developing the story, character dynamics, and various in-world cultures

# Planning

The images on the left are concept sketches created for Chaaya’s appearance. Her style is mainly inspired from ancient Persian & Indian fashion. Each sketch focused on visually evidencing a specific attribute of chaaya’s character.

Finalising these designs helped me decide on a demonic/ spider-like appearance, which focuses on her desire to be feared and thus avoid confrontation.

# Conclusion

I am quite pleased with my final Photoshop illustration. However, In retrospect, I would have liked to further dehumanise her appearance and amplified the spider theme.
