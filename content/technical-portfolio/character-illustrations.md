summary: Original, visually distinct character designs with a focus on diversity. Inclusing personal work and commissions.
---

This section features a range of my character designs. Most were created for personal development, with commissions clearly labeled. My focus is on creating original, visually distinct characters, with an emphasis on diversity, something I explored in depth during my master’s and continue to prioritize in my work.

### Skills Gained:
- Strong anatomy and figure drawing
- Costume and material rendering
- Expression and posing
- Color theory and lighting
- Skilled in drawing diverse hair types and facial features

# Random Colour Challange:

This is a challange I participated on Tik Tok (@yumi_jaleley) for engagement. It involves generating random colors for different features of a character—skin, hair, eyes, clothing, etc. The goal is to work with the colours rather than against to create an aesthetically pleasing design as well as visually convey a narrative/personality. This exercise pushes my creativity, forcing me to use the unexpected color choices to inspire a visual story that feels connected and intentional. These characters were very appealing to my audience, with my most popular video reaching almost 30k views. All the drawings were completed in no more than a day.

# Character Commissions

<br/>

### Claudia the Vampire

This commission had a very open brief: I was asked to design "phase 1" of a vampire character's development, which the client would continue building for their own art account. The design needed a clear narrative and strong personality.

I chose to dress her in clothing typical of the vampire archetype: goth, Victorian, latex etc... but gave her 4C hair she’s clearly trying to straighten out. This serves as a metaphor for her failed attempts to fit in, reflecting a character who hasn’t yet learned to embrace herself. The stark white-platinum hair and bright red eyes, contrasted with a subdued black and purple outfit, reinforce the feeling that she’s wearing a costume rather than something authentic.

### The Emissary

This commission was for a Dungeons & Dragons NPC. The client provided a detailed sketch and description, asking me to bring their character to life.

The Emissary is a snarky, rude, and foul old treefolk. I used a wooden texture for his skin, adding moss and rust to emphasize his age and lack of hygiene. A hunched posture and snarky expression help reflect his thorny personality. Leaving his mouth agape mid-sentence helps immerssion, helping the players imagine him speaking through the client's voice.
