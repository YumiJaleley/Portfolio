HydroZero is a personal project that investigates innovative product and package design, using audience & competitor research to create a fully sustainable skin care product with 3D models, dieline templates and more.

### Skills Gained:
- Creating brand identity with a logo, colour scheme and more.
- Creating dieline templates & packaging designs.
- Use of audience & competitor research to inform designs
- Use of Photoshop & Illustrator.
- Use of Maya for realistic 3D rendering or packaging.

# Research

Choosing to produce a P&G skin care product for young adults (ages 18 - 25) in the UK who are interested in sustainability, I began by conducting research on P&G’s style. In doing so, I assure my product will follow their strong & elegant branding identity. Following this, I conducted competitor research to find a gap in the market. I discovered most brands use a black & white colour scheme with very simplistic, “scientific” designs. Therefore, my product will stand out by using a more stylised design and heavily lean on sustainability.

# Deliverables

Discovering that “waterless” skin care products were becoming trendy, I had the idea of using waterless, dissolvable “pearls” for a face moisturizer. This way, a 100% plasticless packaging could be used, as well as having the bonus effect of a long lasting, concentrating product. For this reason I chose the name “HydroZero”. <br/>
I created deliverables, a moodboard and 2 personas to further inform my product. Following this I created a sketch concept of the moisturizer pearls package, as well as a powdered soap to also demonstrate a unified product line.

# Packaging Design

Using my moodboard & brand specifications, I created a series of Logos and packaging options using Photoshop & Maya. Always focusing on the themes of effectivness, elegance and clear sustainability. The moisturizer package includes a childlock & wide hand grip, to remove risk of children ingesting the pearls.

# Survey

To ensure the most successful design is selected, I enquired on my market demographic through a survey. Through this, I discovered that young adults are alarmingly concerned with skin care and are most interested in products catering to their specific skin type. As my audience was very split on 2 packaging designs, I had the idea to use them both to create products for specific skin types, appealing to their needs and assuring a higher buy rate.

# Final Deliverables

I created dieline templates from scratch of the main moisturizer and soap designs.

I created the final 3D models in Maya, including visual instructions on the inner lid, to clearly show to use the product without the issue of language.
