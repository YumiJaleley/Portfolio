Beyond the physical outcome, this project serves to show my capabilities in innovative thinking, creativity and use of gamification.
<br/><br/>
This BA brief tasked us with creating a piece of media to persuade parents with school age children to make a £2 monthly donation to WaterAid. <br/>

### Skills Gained:
- Use of market research to make an effective design.
- Use of brand research to make an authentic representation.
- Use of Adobe After Effects 3D animation.
- Use of Adobe Photoshop, colour theory & illustration for character & environment design.

<br/><br/>

# Audience & Brand Research

I conducted several interviews on my selected audience of parents with school age children. In doing so, I gathered certain useful points: 
 
- Significant fear of fraud.
- A desire to see handeling of their donations.
- Charities that provide primary needs are more important.
- Monthly donations are preferable.
- Generally prefer logos approach over ethos
- Mostly use platforms YouTube & Facebook.

# Concept

A 360 choice based experience to increase immersion and activity. Presenting a narrative from the perspective of a £2 coin, in order to demonstrate WaterAid’s use of donations and decrease the stigma of fraud or misuse. Primarily, the animation shows that the donations are being used to provide access to water sources or toilets, showing WaterAid’s provision of primary needs

# Storyboard

I created a detailed storyboard, showing the perspective of a £2 coin as it makes its way from a WaterAid meeting to becoming a faucet in an area in need.
