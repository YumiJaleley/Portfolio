# Studio Wife

The following illustrations and pieces of concept art were created for unreleased game "We are All Stars in the Galaxy" by indie game studi 'Studio Wife'. The pieces of character concept art were created from personality and style descriptions. While the poster illustration and logo were improved from previous works. Due to the tight crunch and my ability to work fast, all individual pieces were created in no more than a day.
